# Annotinder R client

This repo basically just imports the annotinder-client, but tweaks it and builds it so that it can be used in the AnnoTinder R package.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ccs-amsterdam/annotinder-r-client
cd annotinder-r-client
npm install
```

Build and bundle

```bash
npm run build
```

Then copy the build folder into annotinder/inst/annotinder-client/
